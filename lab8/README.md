The spikes on the skyscrapers and the color of the buildings were inspired by the New York image.

Partner response: They swapped out the building models with their own house assets. They recolored them for this assignment using Capitola buildings they had photos of as reference. They also downloaded a sand texture to use as the ground.
They used Unity while I used threejs so we didn't really talk about the specifics of how we made them so I don't learn anything from them.
